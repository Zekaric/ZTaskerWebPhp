/* zLockCreate *********************************************************************

Author: Robbert de Groot

Description:

This is a simple locking mechanism for PHP and web activity.  

To lock on anything you provide a string to lock.  Basically a name of the lock.

   $lock = zLockCreate("MyLockName");
   if ($lock == "")
   {
      // We did not get a lock.
   }
   else
   {
      // $lock is the actual lock name.
   }

What is happening is that we are trying to make a directory on the server's file
system.  This is an atomic operation that if two processes/threads are trying
to do the same thing will result in failure for one of them.  I.E. One process
will create the directory and succeed.  The other will try to do the same but
will fail because the directory has been created by the other process. 

If you are trying to lock a file there is a special function for that.

   $lock = zLockCreateFile("myfilename");
   if ($lock == "")
   {
      // We did not get a lock.
   }
   else
   {
      // $lock is the actual lock name.
   }

This will make a folder called "lock_file_" + "myfilename".  

Unlocking the named lock or file lock is done using...

   zLockDestroy($lock);

This just removes the folder that was created earlier when locking.  This allows
the other processes to then create a lock of the same name or file.  

As I said this is a simple locking mechanism.  This could easily starve a 
process if there are too many processes competing for the same lock.  So this
is not perfect and wasn't intended to be. Some other locking mechanism should
be employed if you are running into such a situation.
